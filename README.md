# Alpha Q Server Setup

Welcome, SysAd. Alpha Q is shifting all it’s management tasks online! As a system administrator, you are tasked with setting up the basic system for the group. Your scripts should be named according to the alias given for each sub task.

## Normal Mode

1. (alias - genUser) Set up 30 user accounts for each domain + 1 Alpha Q head with permission management. The users must be named as follows:
   - sysAd_01, sysAd_02 ….sysAd_30
   - appDev_01, appDev_02, ….appDev_30
   - webDev_01, webDev_02, ….webDev_30
   - Jay_Jay (head of Alpha Q)
   Among these accounts, profile_01 - profile_10 are second years, profile_11 - profile_20 are third years, profile_21 - profile_30 are fourth years.

2. (alias - permit) Set up permissions for accounts which follow the hierarchy:
   - Second years can view only their own home directory.
   - Third years can view their own home directory as well as all the home directories of second years of their domain.
   - Fourth years can view their own home directory as well as the home directories of second and third years of their domain.
   - Jay_Jay can read all the other users' home directories.

3. (alias - schedule) Alpha Q has regular meetings to discuss what their members are working on frequently. You are provided with a text file with the dates of future meetings(`future.txt`). Create a file `schedule` in each user's home directory with two columns, `date` and `time`. This file should be updated with the meeting schedule if there is a meeting that day.


4. (alias - attendance) You are given a log of when members joined the meetings in a file `attendance.log`. Write a script for the head to get a list of members who were absent when passed two dates as parameters. If no arguments are passed then find the absentees and the dates they were absent till today. 

## Superuser Mode

Use the `attendance.log` file for this task.

1. (alias - genMoM) The last second year to join a meet is repsonsible for taking MoM (Minutes of Meeting; a doc where the main points of the meet are jotted down). Find the last second year to join the meet. In that user's home directory, create a file with the name in the format `${date}_mom`, where ${date} represents the date of the particular meeting. Add some random text to it.

2. (alias - getMoM) The head should be able to view the MoM records between two given dates. Create a script which the head can run to generate a file in their home directory with a table having each week’s MoMs, along with the person who took the MoM and the date. The MoM should be obtained from the MoM taker’s home directory.

### Files For the task

## Submission

All the text files mentioned should be plain text files and not excel tables. The files should just have text in it, with no borders and lines. Write a script to incorporate all the alias commands to the `.bashrc` file.

Create a GitHub repository and upload the scripts and text files and submit the link in the inductions dashboard and to your mentor.
